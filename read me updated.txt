Forum thread: https://www.zen-cart.com/showthread.php?98315-Attribute-image-replaces-main-product-image-on-select-Support-Thread


In this improved verson, the main image remains the same for the attribute which does not have attribute images and returns
to the product image after selecting an attribute that doesn't have an attribute image. It also now supports at least using
the image provided by image handlers such as Image Handler version 4 or version 5 and showing the swapped image inside of
Zen Colorbox.
This module provides the functionality to get the attribute image in place of the main product image when the user selects
the particular attribute.
This functionality has full control through admin. It can be turned on and off for designated option names from the admin.
It is very easy to integrate with zen cart.
The image selected is also carried over into the shopping cart through an observer.  If there is existing software that
displays the attribute dependent selected image, then recommend that the installation of the feature added here be omitted.

To use this functionality,
rename the YOUR_TEMPLATE directory found in 2_ZC_Version/YOUR_VERSION/includes/modules to the name of your template and merge 
the contents of the file(s) in that folder with the file(s) in your existing template folder.  YOUR_VERSION is the base Zen Cart
Version of your store such as Zen Cart 1.5.5 would be in ZC155.  The latest stable version of the file(s) in this folder have been
included; however, it is most important to simply incorporate the change(s) made to support this software.  The file has been made
compatible with potteryhouse's stock by attributes, with products attribute grid and was based on ZC 1.5.5.  

In the root directory of 1_Main_Files is a copy of ZC 1.5.6b's ajax.php file that was updated in June 2019 and which should be an
improved version over previous ZC versions and it should also replace the use of attrib_prod_info.php and add the protection
offered by ZC functionality.  Until this file is found to produce a compatibility problem, it will be carried in the 1_Main_Files
section.

Two ways to address the admin files of 1_Main_Files and 2_ZC_Version: either rename the admin folder to your *SECRET* admin directory name and upload
both the newly named admin directory and the includes folders to the root of your store (suggest merging file contents
wherever an existing file is present in your store's copy), or can copy/merge the contents of the admin directory into
the admin directory of your store.

Running the sql query in the admin, tools->install SQL Patches area will add the products options type link and nothing
extra, although the true functionality of that option does not yet appear to be revealed, so probably could be omitted.
If the products options type link is already present, there is no need to run the sql again as there have been no updates.

Install/copy this module and (if desired to access the option name type of link) run the sql query using tools->admin sql patches. 
To turn this functionality ON select the option name in option name manager and put the value 6, 7, or 8 in Attribute Style for Radio Buttons/Checkbox:text box.
It also works for check box and has additional option type Link.
Attribute images shown on the product listing page can be made off by entering an Attribute Style value 7 (swap will not occur) or 
Attribute Style value 8 where the swap will occur.
For those that wish to merge the functionality further with other javascript related code, the product image is returned
from the file: includes/classes/ajax/zcAttrib_prod_info.php and the function swap_image of the class.
The return code will be json_encoded by ajax.php then will go through JSON.parse on the receiving page.  Thus, addition
of other javascript into that return will have to be properly escaped to maintain valid JSON throughout the communication.
Code for color-box or other main-image modifiers can be added to that return result.

The file includes/classes/observers/auto.attrib_image_swap_shopping_cart.php was added to handle replacing the product's
image with the attribute related image as configured by this plugin.  If another plugin performs the same operation and is
preferred, then this file can be omitted from the installation.
Will appreciate response. Please provide comment about the plugin to further upgrade this module.
Thanks. 

If after installation/load of the includes/modules/YOUR_TEMPLATE/attributes.php (not necessary nor included for ZC 1.5.7)
you find that standard dropdown (select) attributes are not displayed, then
either you haven't updated to ZC 1.5.5 or higher and an older ZC plugin has removed expected
database values or the upgrade was not properly completed.  At any rate, the most
likely solution is to run the contents of the sql_run_missing_dropdowns.txt file
through the admin->Tools->Install SQL Patches tool to restore the necessary 
database records.

For all installations, the following file(s) do not need to be uploaded to the server:
read me updated.txt
sql_run.txt
sql_run_missing_dropdowns.txt
sql_run_remove.txt

For new installations or updates after v1.5.6 of this plugin, the following additional file(s) do not need to be uploaded to the server:
attrib_prod_info.php
includes/functions/extra_functions/vishal_functions.php

For upgrades to v1.5.6 of this plugin, the following file(s) should be removed from the server:
attrib_prod_info.php
includes/functions/extra_functions/vishal_functions.php

For upgrades from 1.5.6 to v1.5.7 of this plugin:
Replace: includes/classes/ajax/zcAttrib_prod_info.php
includes/classes/observers/auto.attrib_image_swap.php
includes/modules/pages/product_info/jscript_ais.php
includes/modules/pages/product_info/on_load_ais.js

Add: admin/includes/auto_loaders/config.attribute_image_swap.php

- Update jQuery/javascript code to not be seen as non-important text and to refactor the code for readability.
- Removed the need for modification or override of all but one file (options name manager).
- Updated the instructions.

Updated 06/16/19, V1.5.10: (mc12345678)
- Primarily updated what is now considered 1_Main_Files.
- Moved files into sub-folders to improve clarity of installation and to identify Zen Cart version specific files.
- Moved admin language defines out of the core language file for options_name_manager.php and placed in a separate file.
- Updated ajax.php file to the Zen Cart V1.5.6b version.
- Addressed a few minor PHP 7.3 related issues.
- Improved incorporation with Zen Colorbox.
- Added display of images for option type 6 when applied to radio buttons and checkboxes as if the image type had been set to 0.
- Added scope declaration for methods in the observer class.
- Updated install and remove SQL, including comments for understanding.

Updated 04/07/18, V1.5.9: (mc12345678)
- Added try/catch javascript style code to support return from shopping cart where attributes do not have an assigned action.
- Added observer to modify the shopping_cart image based on selections made when adding the product to the cart.
- Corrected an encoding issue with the ajax file (Changed from UTF-8 with BOM to ANSI)
- Added the $zco_notifier to the ajax file to support changes made in the module main_product_images to offer the use of observers.
- Reworked the ajax file to offer up-front processing.
- Added a function (get_attrib_image) to the observer class to reduce code redundancy and to offer a consistent image retrieval method.

Updated 07/16/17, V1.5.8: (mc12345678)
- Incorporated an option to swap the attribute image but not to show the attribute image adjacent to the attributes.
- Added some code commenting in areas to highlight code changes needed for installation.
- Incorporate additional data type casting to ensure data is provided in a known format.
- Reduce the file checking if PRODUCTS_IMAGE_LARGER_TEXT_FILE_IMAGE is defined and set to off.
- Incorporate the code applicable to zen colorbox (https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1322) to support
    the swapped image being used within the colorbox in version 2.1.0 of that plugin or higher.
- Further refined the display/transmission of the additional javascript handling image swap if the setting(s) support 
    displaying the image (ie. a status of 6 or 8 at this time as a status of 7 disables the display of attribute images.
- Corrected initial load (reload upon return from shopping cart with product in the cart) functionality to properly handle
    checkbox and radio selections, also to not try to take image action while updating the quantity of product.

Discussion of changes for v1.5.7:
- Added "Removal" of most of the javascript code if the admin option to not display attribute images is set to true.  This
is expected to have a positive impact on load speed for such conditions.
- Modified the approach to the image swap, but left behind the previous code with it commented out.  The reason is that
  now instead of returning a newly formatted image (which requires more device communication), the original image is
  "restored" if there is no attribute image assigned.
- Added some console logging of debug information if the attempt to execute the initialization code fails.
